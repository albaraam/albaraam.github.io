### DevOps

My Passion in web development started since I was a little boy, my first website was online while I'm in Grade 9 (14 years old), it's still [online](http://teachmeweb.4t.com/) (and still like a ___*****___).
I got my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science in 2012 (22 years ago) from the ___Lebanese University___.

Today, and for the last couple of years (~4), I have worked on many interesting projects, involved of corporate websites, web solutions, mobile applications for both android & IOS using Cordova (aka Phonegap) backed up with Rest API's. And I was responsible of every stage of development from frontend (___HTML5___, ___CSS3___, ___JQuery___, ___Vanilla Javascript___) to backend (___PHP___, ___Yii Framework___, ___Custom CMS___, ___Amazon Services___) to mobile apps (___Cordova___, ___Framework7___, ___Ionic___, ___Android - Java___)  even to planning & architecture (___Database Structure___, ___REST API Desgin___, ___Design Patterns___,...).

### Entrepreneurship

Also I involved in some startups like ___Arab Interns___ & ___GeoMI___ as a __CTO__, where I got my entrepreneurship spirit. It was awsome experience, that I'm still looking forward to work with startups.

Okay, since I was kid (again), I loved Movies and I loved the idea to make my own, so I started learning about everything (on youtube & online courses) from directing, lighting, cinematography, sound design, editing, visual effects, ... I actually did some short films (mostly action films) with my cousins and school friends, but there are nothing on youtube. Oops I just remembered, there is one [check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEaeX-RFWXs)
